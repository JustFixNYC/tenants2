checks:
  similar-code:
    # This setting is confusing, I wanted to configure it to
    # only complain if 3 or more instances of similar code is
    # found (it defaults to 2), but changing the threshold to
    # 3 made it even *more* sensitive, so I'm just disabling
    # it entirely now.
    enabled: false
  argument-count:
    # This isn't a very useful check for Python code because
    # it's perfectly fine to have functions that take lots
    # of arguments, as long as most of them are passed as kwargs.
    enabled: false
  return-statements:
    # This isn't a very useful check for Python code because
    # it's mostly personal preference - sometimes it's better
    # to have lots of return statements than a lot of
    # nested ifs.
