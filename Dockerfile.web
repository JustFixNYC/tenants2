# This Dockerfile can be used to deploy a production instance
# to Heroku.
#
# It builds upon the image in the base Dockerfile, adding
# extra directives to install all dependencies, generate static
# assets, and so forth, so that the final container is completely
# self-contained.

# The way we're using lots of layers here is intentional, as
# we're first installing our dependencies--which don't change
# very often--and then copying over the rest of our source code,
# which does change often. This means we can iterate faster
# because we e.g. don't have to re-install all our dependencies
# if we change a single line of code (it also reduces the amount
# of data we need to transfer to send our image somewhere, if
# the destination already has cached layers from previous
# builds we've sent).
