This is an attempt at creating a new Tenants app for JustFix.

## Quick start

You'll need Python 3.7 and [pipenv][], as well as Node 8.

First create an environment file and optionally edit it as you
see fit:

```
cp .justfix-env.sample .justfix-env
```

Then set up the front-end and configure it to
continuously re-build itself as you change the source code:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then, in a separate terminal, you'll want to instantiate
your Python virtual environment and enter it:

```
pipenv install --dev --python 3.7
pipenv shell
```

(Note that if you're on Windows and have `bash`, you
might want to run `pipenv run bash` instead of
`pipenv shell`, to avoid a bug whereby command-line
history doesn't work with `cmd.exe`.)

Then start the app:

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

## Running tests

To run the back-end Python/Django tests, use:

```
pytest
```

To run the front-end Node/TypeScript tests, use:

```
npm test
```

You can also use `npm run test:watch` to have Jest
continuously watch the front-end tests for changes and
re-run them as needed.

## Environment variables

For help on environment variables related to the
Django app, run:

```
python manage.py envhelp
```

Alternatively, you can examine
[project/justfix_environment.py](project/justfix_environment.py).

For the Node front-end, the only environment variable that
matters right now is `NODE_ENV`, which can be set to
`production` for production or any other value for
development.

## GraphQL

The communication between server and client occurs via [GraphQL][]
and has been structured for type safety. This means that we'll
get notified if there's ever a mismatch between the server's
schema and the queries the client is generating.

[GraphQL]: https://graphql.org/

### Server-side GraphQL schema

The server uses [Graphene-Django][] for its GraphQL needs.

The JSON representation of its schema is in `schema.json` and
is automatically regenerated by the development server,
though developers can manually regenerate it via
`python manage.py graphql_schema --indent 2` if needed.

[Graphene-Django]: http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/

### Client-side GraphQL queries

Client-side GraphQL code is generated as follows:

1. Raw queries are in `frontend/lib/queries/` and given a `.graphql`
   extension.  Currently, they must consist of **one** query,
   mutation, or fragment that has the same name as the base name of the file.
   For instance, if the file is called `SimpleQuery.graphql`,
   then the contained query should be called `SimpleQuery`, e.g.:

    ```graphql
    query SimpleQuery($thing: String) {
        hello(thing: $thing)
    }
    ```

2. The querybuilder, which runs as part of `npm start`, will notice
   changes to any of these raw queries *or* the server's `schema.json`,
   and do the following:

    1. It runs [Apollo Code Generation][] to validate the raw queries
       against the server's GraphQL schema and create TypeScript
       interfaces for them.

    2. For queries and mutations, it adds a function to the TypeScript
       interfaces that is responsible for performing the query in a
       type-safe way.
       
    3. The resultant TypeScript interfaces and/or function is written
       to a file that is created next to the original `.graphql` file
       (e.g., `SimpleQuery.ts`).

    If the developer prefers not to rely on `npm start`
    to automatically rebuild queries for them, they can also manually
    run `node querybuilder.js`.

At this point the developer can import the final TS file and use the query.

## Running the server in production mode

Occasionally you might want to run the server in production mode on your
local system, without actually deploying it, to ensure that everything
works in production.

One quick way to do this is to run:

```
python manage.py runprodserver
```

## Deployment

The app uses the [twelve-factor methodology][], so
deploying it should be relatively straightforward.

At the time of this writing, however, the app's
runtime environment does need *both* Python and Node
to execute properly, which could complicate matters.

### Deploying to Heroku

This app can be deployed to Heroku. You'll need to
configure your Heroku app to use [multiple buildpacks][];
specifically, the `heroku/nodejs` buildpack needs to be
first and the `heroku/python` buildpack second.

You'll likely want to use [Heroku Postgres][] as your
database backend.

#### Deploying to Heroku via Docker

It's also possible to deploy to Heroku using their
[Container Registry and Runtime][].  To push the
container to their registry, run:

```
heroku container:push --recursive
```

Then to deploy it, run:

```
heroku container:release web
```

##### Locally testing the production Docker container

You can build the production Docker container locally with:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.web -t tenants2 .
```

Then you can run it:

```
docker run --rm -it -e PORT=8000 -p 8000:8000 -e USE_DEVELOPMENT_DEFAULTS=yup tenants2
```

You can visit the server at http://localhost:8000/ and even create accounts
and such, as it uses an ephemeral SQLite database built-in to the
container, but the data will go away once the container is removed.
