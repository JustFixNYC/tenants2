          An <strong>HP (Housing Part) Action</strong> is a legal case you can bring against your landlord for failing to make repairs, not providing essential services, or harassing you. Here is how it works:
        </p>
        <ol className="has-text-left">
          <li>Answer a few questions about your housing situation.</li>
          <li>We provide you with a pre-filled packet of all the paperwork youâ€™ll need. 
.</li>
          <li><strong>Print out this packet and bring it to Housing Court.</strong> It will include instructions for <strong>filing in court</strong> and <strong>serving your landlord</strong>.
</li>
        </ol>
        <CenteredPrimaryButtonLink to={Routes.hp.issues.home}>
          Start my case
        </CenteredPrimaryButtonLink>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <strong>You do not need a lawyer to be successful in an HP Action.</strong> You must be able to show the court that repairs are needed and what those repairs are. This includes photo evidence of the issues, HPD inspection reports, and communication with your landlord.
        </p>
