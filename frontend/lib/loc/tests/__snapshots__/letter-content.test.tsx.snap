    Dear 
    LANDLORDO CALRISSIAN
    ,
  </p>
  <p>
    I need the following repairs in my home referenced below and/or in the common areas of the building:
  </p>
  <h2>
    Repairs required

  <h3>
    Entire home and hallways
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      No Heat

    <h2>
      Available access dates
    </h2>
    <p>
      Below are dates that I am available to be at my home to let in a repair worker. Please contact me (using the information provided at the top of this letter) in order to make arrangements with me
       
      <strong>
        at least 24 hours in advance
      </strong>
      .
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Friday, May 1, 2020
      </li>

    <h2>
      Requirements
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to keep my household safe, I request that anyone entering my home to make repairs follow sanitation guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), including washing their hands before entering, wearing gloves, a mask, and shoe coverings, and practicing physical distancing (keeping 6 feet of distance between me and anyone else in my household).
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I request that you provide the name and contact information for any repair worker assigned to my home at least 24 hours prior to their arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be advised that the lack of Heat and/or Hot Water constitutes an emergency under the NYC Housing Maintenance Code, Title 27, Chapter 2. Failure to address these repairs will result in an escalation of this issue, and I may exercise my right to file an Emergency HP Action through the NYC Housing Court system.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Previous Attempts for Relief
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have already contacted 311 on several occasions, but the issue has not been resolved. In the meantime, I have recorded evidence of the violations should legal action be necessary.
    </p>

  <div

    <h2>
      Civil penalties
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pursuant to NYC Admin Code § 27-2115 an order of civil penalties for all existing violations for which the time to correct has expired is as follows:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        “C” Violation
      </dt>
      <dd>
        $50 per day per violation (if 1-5 units)
        <br />
        $50-$150 one-time penalty per violation plus $125 per day (5 or more units)
      </dd>
      <dt>
        “B” Violation:
      </dt>
      <dd>
        $25-$100 one-time penalty per violation plus $10 per day
      </dd>
      <dt>
        “A” Violation”
      </dt>
      <dd>
        $10-$50 one-time penalty per violation
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div
    class="jf-avoid-page-breaks-within"
  >
    <p>
      According to the NYC Admin Code § 27-2115, a civil penalty is also issued where a person willfully makes a false certification of correction of a violation per violation falsely certified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a time to have these repairs made at the number provided above.
