Hi there,

Sometimes you just want to send a simple HTML email with a simple design and clear call to action. This is it.

Call To Action: https://example.com/

This is a really simple email template. Its sole purpose is to get the recipient to click the button with no distractions.

Good luck! Hope it works.

Here is some footer text.
