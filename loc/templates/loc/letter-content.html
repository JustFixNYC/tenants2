  <p>
    I need the following repairs in my apartment referenced below and/or in the public areas
    of the building:
  </p>

  <h2>Repairs required</h2>

  {% for area, area_issues in issues %}
    <h3>{{ area }}</h3>
    <ul>
      {% for issue in area_issues %}
        <li>{{ issue }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endfor %}

  {% if access_dates %}
    <div class="jf-avoid-page-breaks-within">
      <h2>Available access dates</h2>
      <p>
      Below are some access dates provided for when repairs can be made.
      Please contact (using the information provided below) in order
      to make arrangements. <strong>Anyone coming to perform repairs
      should arrive no later than 12pm during the provided dates.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
      {% for date in access_dates %}
          <li>{{ date }}</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
  {% endif %}

  {% if onboarding_info.has_called_311 %}
  <p>
    I have already contacted 311 on several occasions, but the issue has not been resolved.
    In the meantime, I have recorded evidence of the violations should legal action be necessary.
  </p>
  {% endif %}
  <p>
    If these repairs are not made immediately I will have no choice but to use my legal
    remedies to get the repairs done.
  </p>

    <h2>Civil penalties</h2>
    <p>
      Pursuant to NYC Admin Code § 27-2115 an order of civil penalties for all existing violations
      for which the time to correct has expired is as follows:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>“C” Violation</dt>
      <dd>
      $50 per day per violation (if 1-5 units)<br/>

      </dd>

  <div class="jf-avoid-page-breaks-within">
    <p>
      Please be advised that NYC Admin Code § 27-2115 provides a civil penalty where a person
      willfully makes a false certification of correction of a violation per violation
      falsely certified.

      Please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a time to have these repairs made at
