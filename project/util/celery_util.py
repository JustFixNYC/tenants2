    return None, but that doesn't seem possible with mypy.)

    When called, this will proxy the function's arguments
    to a Celery worker.

    In order for this to work, the original function must
    have been registered as a Celery task that ignores its
    result.

    Note that if Celery has been configured with
    `TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER`, the task will run synchronously.
