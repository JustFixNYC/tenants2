class InstanceChangeTracker:
    '''
    A utility class that can be used to help keep track of whether a model's
    fields have changed during its lifetime as a Python object.

    It is *not* useful for tracking a model's changes over time in a database.

    For example, given the following model:

        >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
        >>> @dataclass
        ... class Thing:
        ...    foo: str
        ...    bar: str
        >>> thing = Thing('hello', 'there')

    We can create a tracker on its "foo" property, which tells us its
    instance hasn't been changed:

        >>> tracker = InstanceChangeTracker(thing, ['foo'])
        >>> tracker.has_changed()
        False

    Once we change the "foo" property, it tells us it has been changed:

        >>> thing.foo = "zzz"
        >>> tracker.has_changed()
        True

    We can then tell it to consider the current state as being unchanged:

        >>> tracker.set_to_unchanged()
        >>> tracker.has_changed()
        False

    # A dictionary that keeps track of the "original" values of a model's
    # fields.
