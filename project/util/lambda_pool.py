@dataclass
class LambdaPool:
    '''
    This class maintains a pool of "warmed up" lambda processes that are
    ready to receive events, and handles communication with them.

    Specifically, by "lambda process" we mean a process that:

        * Is a language interpreter (by default, Node.js) running a script.

        * Waits until it receives a UTF-8 JSON-encoded blob as input
          (known as the "event") via stdin, returns a UTF-8 JSON-encoded
          blob (known as the "response") via stdout, and then terminates.
          This core functionality is called the "handler".

    By "warmed up" we mean that the lambda process has already been
    started and is ready to receive input, so that when the caller
    needs to send it an event, it doesn't need to worry about delays
    caused by the lambda process' startup time.

    This class is also responsible for shutting down the processes when
    the caller's process terminates.
